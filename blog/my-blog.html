            <h1>Working under pressure</h1>
            <h3>December 21st, 2022</h3>
            <h4>by Robert Whisenhunt</h4>
            <p>These past few months have been very rough on me. My mother and I weren't able to afford a new lease back
                in August<br>
                and had to put most of our belongings in a storage unit and move into a hotel room that the church
                helped us afford.<br>
                Early September, my mother had a bad fall and broke her left hip. I was the one that found her as I
                returned to the hotel<br>
                room from taking the laundry to the laundry mat at the hotel. During this time, I was just into the fall
                semester of my online<br>
                collage courses. My mother insisted I stay at the hotel, finish the laundry, and do my schoolwork; so I
                stayed.<br>
                <br>
                She was in the hospital over night and had surgery the next day. Following her surgery, she knew that
                rehab would be<br>
                the better option, but because of her previous history at rehab earlier this year, she refused to go and
                insisted on coming<br>
                back to the hotel. My stepsister brought her back to the hotel and said she hated this was put on me and
                wished me luck.<br>
                So, that night it was me taking care of my mother, despite her being back so soon. I had to help her to
                the bathroom<br>
                a total of seven times throughout the night and morning. The seventh trip in which she didn't make it
                and made a mess<br>
                on the bathroom floor. She told me to call 911 to take her back to the hospital, and they came to take
                her back to the hospital.<br>
                <br>
                Once back at the hospital, she finally agreed to go to a rehab center to get the professional help she
                needed. While she was<br>
                in rehab, I continued to do the best I could to continue with my schoolwork, but also had the stress of
                finding a new place for<br>
                us to call home, as well as take care of the cat and myself. Stress became so bad that I developed
                issues with my blood pressure<br>
                and my doctor put me on blood pressure medicine. It started to become difficult to focus on my
                schoolwork as weeks went by with<br>
                mom in rehab, learning new complications that started going on with her. I started to fall behind on
                some of my schoolwork, which<br>
                made me more stressed because that was more work to do on top of everything else I was dealing with at
                the time.<br>
                <br>
                November came, and mom was sent to the hospital to get tests done to figure out what was causing the
                complications she was having<br>
                such as fluids in her abdomon and legs. They discovered that the source of the fluids was her liver, and
                that she was at end-stage<br>
                cirrhosis and had her sent to a hospice care facility. This made focusing on schoolwork even harder, but
                I was doing the best I could<br>
                to catch up on what I was behind on. My sister would pick me up and take me to visit mom, which seeing
                her in her condition was<br>
                difficult.<br>
                <br>
                Friday, November 25th, my sisters and I met a church member at the hospice care faclity as the church
                member was offering to give<br>
                her what he called an "end of life blessing". Knowing it would be difficult to experience, I wanted to
                assist by placing my hands<br>
                on mom's head as he conducted the blessing. I had asked for some one on one time with my mom prior to
                the blessing. While I was<br>
                with her, I wanted her to hear it from my own mouth that I would be okay and that she didn't have to
                worry about me. I told her<br>
                I had many friends already showing their support and that I was in good hands. She was unable to talk,
                and was half awake, but she<br>
                was able to nod her head a few times while I was talking to her. It was a difficult moment, but a moment
                I was thankful to have.<br>
                <br>
                The next day, my stepsister called me and told me the nurses deemed mom as non-responsive and that she
                was showing color change<br>
                and that it wouldn't be long at that point. The next day, November 27th, my sister woke me up a little
                after 6pm and was crying.<br>
                Without her telling me, I just knew, but I said "I'm guessing she passed huh?..." and my sister, while
                crying, say yes. She herself<br>
                witnessed our mother take her last breath. I have been a mess since, as depression from grief has taken
                me over for the past couple<br>
                of weeks. My instructors have been very nice and understanding through this rough time I am
                experiencing, and one of them is giving me<br>
                a last minute chance to hopefully clutch a passing grade. Which is what I am doing right now, spending
                all night and morning to get<br>
                everything done that he has requested and hope for the best.<br>
                <br>
                It has been difficult having to type this up and re-live everything I've gone through these past couple
                of months, but if it means<br>
                succeeding in this course that I worked so hard on getting through and was doing so well before
                everything went down hill, then it is<br>
                worth it. I've been going at it since 2am this morning. As I am typing this, it is just barely after
                9am. I have until 11am to have<br>
                everything submitted. During this time, I've learned how to create a wireframe for the homepage of this
                blog web page. I didn't have<br>
                time to make a wireframe for the two child pages, so I kind of wung it from there, but I can honestly
                say that I have learned a lot<br>
                from this course, and I am very thankful for my instructor in giving me this last minute chance.<br>
                <br>
                Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I am going to do the remaining two assignments now, and
                hope for the best and then<br>
                put my focus on my mother's funeral services after this is all done and see what the winter semester has
                in store for my future.<br>
                If everything goes well and I pass this course, I will just have two more courses left to complete my
                Computer Programming Certificate.<br>
                Which is why I'm taking this last minute chance that I have been given. It's been a lot of pressure, and
                even got anxious once, but<br>
                I am managing and will get everything done on time.<br>
                <br>
                Thank you for reading this, thank you Mt. Dew Code Red for helping me stay awake, and have a Merry Christmas.
