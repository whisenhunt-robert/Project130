            <h3>Hello World!</h3>
            <p>My name is Robert, I'm an online degree student taking courses from Brigham Young University-Idaho.<br>
                I'm currently working on the Computer Programming Certificate. I've learned quite a bit already, but
                there's still much more to learn.<br>
                Here are a few key things about myself that I don't mind sharing with you:</p>
            <h3><b>I love to be creative</b></h3>
            <p>I love to build levels on Super Mario Maker 2 on the Nintendo Switch and watch twitch streamers
                suffer... err... enjoy the challenges they bring.<br>
                Other things I've used my creative mind on include poetry and backstories for Roleplay characters on
                Final Fantasy XIV.<br>
                Overall, I just enjoy using my creative mind anyway I can, and hope to someday find a career where I
                can use it to earn an income.</p>
            <h3><b>Pizza Lover</b></h3>
            <p>The first essay I had to write in the English course during Pathways was a love letter to a thing I
                love. It couldn't be a person, or a place.<br>
                So, I wrote a love letter to pizza (ask and maybe I'll let you read it). The pizza in my picture on the
                home page is
                a 24-inch New York Style from Mario's Pizza.</p>
            <h3><b>Disability</b></h3>
            <p>I have Tourette's Syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorder, which comes with Anxiety, Depression, OCD,
                and some learning disabilities.<br>
                So I ask to be patient with me if I'm a little slow at times. Because of my disability, I never
                imagined myself here. Thanks to the church and the Pathway program, here I am. For with God nothing
                shall be impossible.</p>
