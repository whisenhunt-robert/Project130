    <h2>Robert Whisenhunt aka "Dahweirdacus"</h2>

    <h3 style="color:royalblue">Hello World!</h3>
    <h4>My name is Robert, I'm an online degree student taking courses from Brigham Young University-Idaho.<br>
    I'm currently working on the Computer Programming Certificate. I've learned quite a bit already, but there's still much more to learn.<br>
  Here are a few key things about myself that I don't mind sharing with you:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b style="color:royalblue">I love to be creative</b></li>
          <p>I love to build levels on Super Mario Maker 2 on the Nintendo Switch and watch twitch streamers suffer... err... enjoy the challenges they bring.<br>
            Other things I've used my creative mind on include poetry and backstories for Roleplay characters on Final Fantasy XIV.<br>
            Overall, I just enjoy using my creative mind anyway I can, and hope to someday find a career where I can use it to earn an income.</p>
        <li><b style="color:royalblue">Pizza Lover</b></li>
          <p>The first essay I had to write in the English course during Pathways was a love letter to a thing I love. It couldn't be a person, or a place.<br>
            So, I wrote a love letter to pizza (ask and maybe I'll let you read it). The pizza in my picture is a 24-inch New York Style from Mario's Pizza.</p>
        <li><b style="color:royalblue">Disability</b></li>
          <p>I have Tourette's Syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorder, which comes with Anxiety, Depression, OCD, and some learning disabilities.<br>
          So I ask to be patient with me if I'm a little slow at times. Because of my disability, I never imagined myself here. Thanks to the church and the Pathway program, here I am. For with God nothing shall be impossible.</p>
    </ul>
